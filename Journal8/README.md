### Assignment Writeup
#### Intentions
Correcting upon Journal 7's project. I added features to detect what semester we are currently in, and only display courses from that semester.
#### Input Work Done
Created a way to detect what semester we are in (for SPXX or FALLXX). 
#### Output Results
Reproduced the functionality of last week, but reducing the information displayed down to the current semester.
#### Approach
I used text parsing and date parsing to cross reference the current semester.
#### Thoughts on the results
I'm happy with the results, and it will create a more robust tool that hopefully Bryan may be able to use for semesteres to come.
