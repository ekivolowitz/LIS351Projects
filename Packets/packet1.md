# Packet 1
## Part 1
1. The Operating System is most responsible for how files are stored on the hard drive.
2. A word is 4 bytes, which is 32 bits.
3. -86 
```
-128 + 32 + 8 + 2
-118 + 32 
-86
```
4. Say that people that really like Gushers also often purchase and really like Fruit by 
the foot. That puts Gushers and Fruit by the Foot in the same neighborhood. Then there is some
way of measuring distance between items, like the difference per user of rating of both of these
items. This is then collected and spread over all of the reviews. Items with a very small distance
are then suggested, thus, item to item recommendation.
5. A user to user recommendation scores a recommendation between two people as the sum of the differences of their reviews. So, if two people score one item identically, their recommendation score is 0. If they then rate another item as a 5, and a 3, then their score becomes 2 (absolute value of 5 - 3). Recommendations of what people with low scores have purchased will then be given.
6. ASCII can only hold up to 128 characters, which can't contain all of the emojis and non ASCII characters from other languages. To only render ASCII and not UTF-8 would make the web inaccessible for many people.
7. A local IP address is one assigned to your device from your router or switch. That's different from the public IP address because it's not publically viewable to anyone off your network. You must also be connected to the same switch or router to see your machine's local IP. A public IP is one assigned to you by your ISP (it may change unless you request a static) so that they can route your traffic to you. 
8. There are 13 route nameservers.
9. Your phone is the client and Facebook's servers is the server.
10. A sampling rate is the number of audio samples of an analog signal per second. The higher the sampling rate of a track, the closer of an approximation your digital signal is to the original analog signal. 
11. That color would be primarily red, but a lighter tone probably skewing more towards a pink.
12. They would be able to zero in on your identity by querying all students that have taken LIS351 in the spring of 2019, who are in a certain section, who have scored the exact score provided in the class data.
13. There are magnetic discs called platters, a needle head, an arm, and a rotor to spin the discs at a certain speed.
