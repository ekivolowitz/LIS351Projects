# Journal 10
I strongly dislike CSS. It's such an interesting
language in that it's incredibly simple, but SO 
difficult. That's what bothers me. I feel like I understand flexbox
and all the stylings, but everytime I try and center an image, I need to 
google 50 different stack overflow posts to figure it out. 
I've been tinkering with CSS for a few years now, but I've never
taken the formal time to learn it. I think that a lot of 
software engineers look down on frontend work, but in truth that's
because they are afraid of it. Lots of people that do front end work
come from coding bootcamps or don't have a formal computer science foundation.
That's where I think more CS majors should look. Knowing what to type for a new 
react class is entirely different from understanding the methods and models 
underneath react that make it work. Rant over.
