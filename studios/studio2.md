# Part 1 
I think the speaker was pretty clear in his delivery. He obviously didn't use the computer mic,
as the audio quality was crystal clear. The speaker was coloquial in his deliver, however
the content he was trying to deliver (describing SQL queries and Access tables) was clear.

I don't think that the speaker provided sufficient background information. There's always more
information to be learned, and part of providing an introductory course is providing information
on where to read more about the topic should you be interested.

The speaker demonstrated simple queries over singular tables. He was successful in demonstrating
the basics of what a SELECT and WHERE clause were used and how they should be used. The speaker
used a selection of where all genders were female for the people within the database. 

I selected the WHERE clause, which is a special component of a query that filters the information into the desired data.

I also looked up a SELECT statement, which is the data from the filtered data that we are
interested in (for example a specific column header).

# Part 2
The speaker was very clear in his message. He was trying to describe basic use cases of MySQL (another relation database management system), which I believe he did successfully. The audio quality was impecable; he definitely did not use a standard computer mic but a professional one. I would say that the production quality for this video, and the other one, are very professional.

I think that the speaker gave sufficient background information about the topic. I wish he had pointed more explicitly to external resources to read for extra information, however he talked about data types, creating a database, a table, entering data with an INSERT statement, updates (ALTER). 

This speaker provided information about just about everything we need from a database. IE how to set one up, insert data, remove data, update data, etc. etc. I also liked that he used MySQL from the command line instead of a GUI because it gives a more direct and powerful interface than a GUI to collect data. 

This speaker mentioned an ALTER command, which is essentially a query command and an update command where you can modify existing data to add new values to fields. 

I also looked up MySQL, which is a powerful Relation Database Management System (RDBMS) that is more extensible that Microsoft Access because of a more expressive command line interface.
