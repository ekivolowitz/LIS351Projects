### URL
The URL for the source code of this project is available here: https://github.com/ekivolowitz/LIS351Projects/tree/master/Journal7 
### Assignment Writeup
#### Intentions
Someone asked me what week we talked about `foo`. I didn't have an answer, but I thought that'd be an easy thing to enumerate with python.
#### Input Work Done
I had to explore with the API to find the assignments lists, which I did in the console in the browser. Then I modified the path and found the data that I wanted. 
#### Output Results
This worked really well - here is an example of the input and output.

#### Approach
To do this, I really just needed to see where the data was. To do that, all I needed 
was to explore the API on the browser. 
#### Thoughts on the results
I'm happy with it. It will 100% make the packets easier...
